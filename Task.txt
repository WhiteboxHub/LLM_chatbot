This folder contains a file called AdvizorPro_Person_04.24.2024-1.csv. Your task is wto build a system to analyze the data using RAG-based LLMs

1.	You can use any data infrastructure you want (Postgres, BigQuery, etc) to store the data.
2.	Using the CRD column from the CSV file, you can find and merge their data from https://brokercheck.finra.org/

4.	You will probably need SQL to join this data. You can use any ETL process you like.
